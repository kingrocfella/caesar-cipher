# Caesar Cipher

This repo contains a JavaScript program that does encryption and decryption using the popular ceaser cipher algorithm. 

### Usage
Simply call the function cipher and supply the necessary arguments as shown below:   

```sh
cipher ("Text",Shift,Action)
```
Where Text is the plain text or sentence that is to be encrypted or decrypted, Shift is the number of shifts required and Action is whether you wish to encrypt or decrypt the Text.
A sample is shown below:

```sh
//encryption
cipher ("This is a simple Ceaser Cipher algorithm",20,'encrypt');
//decryption
cipher ("Nbcm cm u mcgjfy Wyumyl Wcjbyl ufailcnbg",20,'decrypt');
```
That's it!
